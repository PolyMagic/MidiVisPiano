This is a small app for visualizing midi files, it was created for educational purposes only and was not intended to be published, but at the end, I decided to upload it in case someone is trying to create something similar and need some reference 

## Why Ja*a?
So this project was created only because I wanted to test how good or bad ja*a is.
It is my first and probably the last project done in Java, so keep in mind that code can be messy
